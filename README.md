# bezier-nd

A Bezier curve class supporting linear, quadratic and cubic Bezier curves,
using an arbitrary point class.

Example uses would be for 2-dimensional Bezier curves whose
coordinates are `[f64; 2]`, or for 3-dimensional Bezier curves using
coordinates of `[f32; 3]`.

The Bezier curve supports bisection, and then splitting into straight
lines within a given `straightness` bound; iterators are provided to
automatically trace a Bezier as lines or points within such a
straightness, for rendering puroses.

The Bezier type also supports rounding of corners and circular arc
generation, utilizing a very accurate function for any angle of
rounding up to 180 degrees, derived from a curve-fit from experimental
data, rather than an explicit mathematical function for the control
point generation (the standard analytical approach).

This crate is in beta; it is used in a small number of applications,
and the functionality is mature; the API is stable, but may be enhanced.

## Usage
